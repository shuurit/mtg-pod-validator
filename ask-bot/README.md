# Ask Bot

A Discord slash command, `/ask`, that lets people in the playgroup server
ask Magic: The Gathering questions and get an AI-generated answer. No
persistent bot process -- Discord calls a Cloudflare Worker over HTTP
whenever someone uses the command, and the Worker calls Cloudflare Workers
AI directly, so there's no separate LLM API key to manage or pay for.

This is a self-contained project (own `package.json`, own Worker, own
deploy) that happens to live in this repo rather than its own -- it isn't
related to the deck-strength app or the `cloudflare-worker/` relay above
it, and doesn't share any code, secrets, or deployment with them.

## How it works

1. Someone types `/ask question: <their question>` in the server.
2. Discord sends that interaction as an HTTP POST to the Worker
   (`src/index.js`).
3. The Worker verifies the request is really signed by Discord (Ed25519,
   via the `discord-interactions` package) before doing anything else.
4. It immediately returns a **deferred** response (Discord shows "Bot is
   thinking..."), because Discord requires an initial response within 3
   seconds and an LLM call is usually slower than that.
5. In the background (`ctx.waitUntil`), it calls Workers AI with the
   question, using a system prompt that frames it as an MTG rules/strategy
   assistant for a playgroup and tells it to say when it's not confident
   rather than guess.
6. It then `PATCH`es the deferred message with the real answer (via
   Discord's follow-up webhook endpoint), truncated to fit Discord's
   2000-character message cap if needed.

## Why a new Discord Application instead of reusing an existing bot

The playgroup's other Discord automation (`fnm-poll`,
`magic-card-of-the-day`) posts entirely through channel **webhooks** --
there's no Discord Application or bot token behind either of them, just a
webhook URL each script `POST`s to. A slash command needs an actual
Application (for its ID/public key, used to verify incoming requests) with
a bot user (for the token used to register the command) and a configured
**Interactions Endpoint URL** that Discord POSTs to -- none of that exists
yet anywhere in the playgroup's setup. So this isn't a case of reusing vs.
recreating an existing bot; it's creating the first one. One new Discord
Application, used only for `/ask`, is the natural choice -- see Setup
below.

## Folder layout

- `src/index.js` -- the Worker: signature verification, PING handling,
  `/ask` command handling, deferred response, Workers AI call, follow-up
  `PATCH`, error handling if the AI call fails.
- `register-commands.js` -- one-off local script (`npm run register`) that
  registers the `/ask` command with Discord. Guild-scoped (instant) if
  `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is set, global (up to an hour to propagate) if not.
- `wrangler.toml` -- Worker config: the `AI` binding for Workers AI, plus
  `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` as plain vars. Both are
  safe to commit -- the only actually sensitive credential is the bot
  token, and that never goes into the Worker at all, only into
  `register-commands.js`'s local `.env`.

## Setup

All commands below run from this folder (`ask-bot/`).

### 1. Create the Discord Application

1. [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   -> **New Application** -> name it (e.g. "MTG Ask Bot").
2. **General Information** tab -> copy the **Application ID** and
   **Public Key** -- these go into `wrangler.toml`.
3. **Bot** tab -> **Reset Token** -> copy the token -- this goes into
   `.env` (step 3 below), never into `wrangler.toml` or anywhere committed.
   Treat it as a secret: regenerate it immediately if it's ever exposed.
4. **OAuth2 -> URL Generator** -> scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
   -> no bot permissions are needed beyond the default (the bot only
   responds to the slash command, it doesn't need to send messages any
   other way) -> open the generated URL and invite it to the playgroup
   server.

### 2. Deploy the Worker

```bash
cd ask-bot
npm install
npx wrangler login
```

Fill in `wrangler.toml`:

- `account_id` -- Cloudflare dashboard sidebar, or `npx wrangler whoami`.
- `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` / `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` -- from step 1.2 above.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Copy the deployed `*.workers.dev` URL from the output.

### 3. Set the Interactions Endpoint URL

Discord Developer Portal -> your app -> **General Information** ->
**Interactions Endpoint URL** -> paste the Worker URL from step 2 -> Save.
Discord immediately sends a test `PING` to verify it -- if `src/index.js`
is deployed correctly, this succeeds right away.

### 4. Register the `/ask` command

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

- `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` -- same as `wrangler.toml`.
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` -- from step 1.3 above.
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` (optional) -- the playgroup server's ID (enable
  Developer Mode in Discord settings, then right-click the server icon ->
  Copy Server ID). Set this while testing for instant registration; leave
  it unset once everything works to register the command globally.

```bash
npm run register
```

### 5. Test it

In the playgroup server, type `/ask question: What does deathtouch do?`
and confirm you get a "Bot is thinking..." followed by a real answer.

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the Worker locally via `wrangler dev`. Testing interactions end to
end still requires a publicly reachable URL for Discord to POST to (e.g. a
temporary tunnel pointed at the local dev server), since Discord doesn't
send interactions to `localhost`.

## Model

Defaults to `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` (set in
`AI_MODEL` in `src/index.js`). For faster/cheaper responses at some
quality cost, swap in `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fp8`.

This rides entirely on Cloudflare's free tiers -- Workers' free request
allowance plus Workers AI's 10,000 free Neurons/day -- which should
comfortably cover casual playgroup usage without needing a paid plan.

## Explicitly out of scope for this pass

- **Rules-grounding / RAG.** Right now the model answers from its own
  training, with no real card text or comprehensive-rules lookup behind
  it. Pulling live card data from Scryfall, or indexing the comprehensive
  rules via Cloudflare Vectorize, is the natural next step once this base
  version is working -- not built yet.
- **Message-content / mention-based triggering** (e.g. "@bot what's..."
  in a regular message). That needs Discord's privileged Message Content
  intent, which is a separate decision -- for now, `/ask` is the only way
  to reach the bot.
